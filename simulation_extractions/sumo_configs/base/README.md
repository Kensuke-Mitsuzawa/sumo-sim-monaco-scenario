These scenarios are originally from [Monaco scenario](https://github.com/lcodeca/MoSTScenario).



In `morning_rush`, I made modifications that

- simulation time durations are until `21600`.
- `less_capacity_config`: I reduced the passenger capacities. Look at `sumo_configs/base/less_capacity_config/in/add/basic.vType.xml`.
- `slow_speed_scenario`
